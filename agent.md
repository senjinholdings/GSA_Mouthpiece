**Motto:** "Small, clear, safe steps — always grounded in real docs."

---

## Principles

* Keep changes minimal, safe, and reversible.
* Prefer clarity over cleverness; simplicity over complexity.
* Avoid new dependencies unless necessary; remove when possible.

---

## Knowledge & Libraries

* Use `context7` (MCP server) to fetch current docs before coding.
* Call `resolve-library-id`, then `get-library-docs` to verify APIs.
* If uncertain, pause and request clarification.

---

## Workflow

* **Plan:** Share a short plan before major edits; prefer small, reviewable diffs.
* **Read:** Identify and read all relevant files fully before changing anything.
* **Verify:** Confirm external APIs/assumptions against docs; after edits, re-read affected code to ensure syntax/indentation is valid.
* **Implement:** Keep scope tight; write modular, single-purpose files.
* **Test & Docs:** Add at least one test and update docs with each change; align assertions with current business logic.
* **Reflect:** Fix at the root cause; consider adjacent risks to prevent regressions.

---

## Code Style & Limits

* **Files:** ≤ 300 LOC; keep modules single-purpose.
* **Comments:** Add a brief header at the top of every file (where, what, why). Prefer clear, simple explanations; comment non-obvious logic.
* **Commenting habit:** Err on the side of more comments; include rationale, assumptions, and trade-offs.
* **Configuration:** Centralize runtime tunables in `config.py`; avoid magic numbers in code and tests. Pull defaults from config when wiring dependencies.
* **Simplicity:** Implement exactly what's requested—no extra features.

---

## Collaboration & Accountability

* Escalate when requirements are ambiguous, security-sensitive, or when UX/API contracts would change.
* Tell me when you are not confident about your code, plan, or fix. Ask questions or help, when your confidence level is below 80%.
    * Assume that you get -4 points for wrong code and/or breaking changes. +1 point for successful changes. 0 point when you honestly tell me you're uncertain.
* Value correctness over speed (a wrong change costs more than a small win).
